    <h1>Timekart | Watch shopping web portal</h1>
    <p>Timekart is developed to demonstrate the functioning of a shopping website. It allows users to create an account, navigate the products (watches), add them to the cart, and finally make a purchase. The site then sends this purchase request to the admin, where they can view the requested order and also perform other actions to maintain the site.</p>
